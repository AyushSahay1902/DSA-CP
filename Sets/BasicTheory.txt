->Set is STL container that used to store uique values.
->Values are stored in ordered state.
->No indexing in sets. Elementss are identified by there own value.
->Once value inserted in a set, it cannot be modefied.
->We can remove any element, burt we cannot modify it.
->Advantages - unique value, ordered, dynamic size, no overflow error, faster insertion/deletion/search - O(logn)
->Disadvantage - No indexing, uses more memory than array, not suitable for large data sets.
->Declaration of Sets.
#include<set>
set<data_type> name;
set<int> set1 = {1,2,3,4} //By default the values are stored in increasing order.
set<int, greater<int>> set_name;
-> insertion:-
set1.insert(4);
set1.insert(2);
-> returns the pointer to the inserted value.
